## Projects
### Uber Data Engineering with GCP

This project dives into the world of Uber data analytics using modern data engineering practices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I've leveraged tools like Mage.ai for building an ETL pipeline, BigQuery for data warehousing, Looker Studio for data visualization, and Cloud Storage for managing data throughout the process.

### Lunar Mission Analysis
With the rapid progress in space technology, landing humans on the Moon is now within our reach. In our project, we carefully studied all the lunar missions conducted worldwide. We looked at both successful and unsuccessful missions, using two sets of data. One dataset covered lunar missions from all countries, while the other focused specifically on Chaandrayaan (India's lunar missions). This approach allowed us to explore the broader picture of global lunar exploration and also dive into the details of India's exciting ventures to the Moon. By combining these datasets, we gained a clear and easy-to-understand insight into humanity's journey to the lunar surface, celebrating achievements and learning from challenges.

### Type 2 Diabetes Prediction

Conducted comprehensive gene expression analysis for the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes, employing advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) algorithm to correct technical variations and improve data integration, resulting in the identification of 75 DEGs associated with T2D, highlighting key biomarkers. Utilized the Louvain clustering method and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to enhance the detection of gene clusters and validate novel transcriptomic signatures, contributing to a more precise understanding of molecular mechanisms.
